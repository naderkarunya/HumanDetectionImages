 Human Detection Image Dataset
ðŸ“¸ Image Collection
The images in this dataset were collected as part of my PhD research in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on human detection. The dataset consists of a diverse set of images containing humans in various environments, poses, and lighting conditions.

The images were captured using a combination of:

Public domain sources (with open licenses)

Surveillance-style camera setups in controlled environments

Manually annotated frames from publicly available videos

The data was curated to include:

Single and multiple persons per frame

Partial occlusions

Varying distances and resolutions

Both indoor and outdoor scenes

All images were reviewed and annotated to ensure relevance and usability for training human detection models.

ðŸ§  Research Use Case
This dataset is used to train and evaluate human detection models based on YOLOv5 architecture integrated with GhostNet as the backbone network. The aim is to improve detection accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Key objectives include:

Enhancing detection speed and performance on edge devices

Improving accuracy in low-light and occluded conditions

Reducing model size using GhostNet for lightweight inference

This work builds upon earlier improvements in object detection by combining the real-time capabilities of YOLOv5 with the efficient design of GhostNet.
